"""
End-to-end duty-cycle simulation runner.

Simulates N duty-cycle windows across a timeline (DECISIONS.md: "record N
seconds every M minutes"), using the synthetic generators to produce audio
and environmental data with randomly injected biological calls, vessel
noise events, and (at most) one storm runoff event. Each window is run
through signal conditioning (Stage 0, docs/ml-pipeline.md) and feature
extraction (Stage 1, docs/ml-pipeline.md), and written to Tier 1 (flat
audio files) and Tier 2 (SQLite), per docs/data-pipeline.md's storage
tiers.

Anomaly detection itself (Stage 2) is deliberately NOT run here -- this
script's job is generation, feature extraction, and storage. Detection and
scoring against ground truth happens in evaluate.py, so detector fitting
and threshold choices live in one place. Because the schema in
docs/data-pipeline.md still requires an `anomaly_flags` row per capture,
this script writes a placeholder (unscored) row for each window; a real
on-device deployment would instead score inline in this same loop
(docs/data-pipeline.md step 5-6).

The first `calibration_windows` windows are deliberately generated with no
anomalies injected, standing in for the initial calibration period Stage 2
(docs/ml-pipeline.md) treats as the normal baseline.
