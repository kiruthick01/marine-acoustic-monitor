# Simulation

## What this is, and isn't

This `/simulation` layer is synthetic data and code standing in for real
hardware until it arrives. Project status is planning/architecture phase --
see [../DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md): no hardware purchased, no field
recordings exist. Everything under `simulation/data_generator/` synthesizes
plausible hydrophone audio and environmental sensor readings (ambient noise,
biological calls, vessel passages, storm runoff events); `simulation/pipeline/`
implements the real Stage 1/2 feature extraction and anomaly detection
described in [../docs/ml-pipeline.md](../docs/ml-pipeline.md), running
against that synthetic data.

This is **not** a claim that the synthetic data matches real underwater
acoustics or water chemistry exactly (see the domain-reasoning comments in
each `synthetic_*.py` module for what's simplified and why). Its purpose is
to let the feature-extraction, storage, and anomaly-detection code be
written, run, and evaluated end-to-end now, so it's ready to point at real
sensor input once hardware exists, instead of being designed blind.

## How to run it

From the repo root:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulation/scripts/run_simulation.py
python simulation/scripts/evaluate.py
```

`run_simulation.py` simulates a run of duty-cycle windows (default 100),
randomly injecting some biological calls and vessel noise events, and
(sometimes) one multi-window storm runoff event, matching the "record N
seconds every M minutes" duty cycle from DECISIONS.md. It writes:

- `simulation/output/audio/*.wav` -- Tier 1 flat audio files, one per window.
- `simulation/output/db.sqlite` -- Tier 2 structured data (captures, feature
  vectors, environmental readings), schema matching
  [../docs/data-pipeline.md](../docs/data-pipeline.md).
- `simulation/output/ground_truth.json` -- which windows got which anomaly
  injected, plus each window's computed feature vector, for evaluation.

The first ~20% of windows are deliberately generated anomaly-free, standing
in for the initial calibration period Stage 2 (docs/ml-pipeline.md) treats
as the normal baseline.

Useful flags: `--n-windows`, `--window-interval-minutes`, `--seed` (for a
reproducible run).

`evaluate.py` loads that ground truth, fits
`BaselineAnomalyDetector` (Isolation Forest) on the calibration-period
windows only, scores every remaining window, and compares its flags against
the known injected anomalies.

## What the printed metrics mean

- **Precision**: of the windows the detector flagged as anomalous, what
  fraction actually had an injected anomaly. Low precision means too many
  false alarms (normal windows getting flagged).
- **Recall**: of the windows that actually had an injected anomaly, what
  fraction the detector caught. Low recall means real events are being
  missed.
- **F1**: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, a single number that
  only scores well if both are reasonably good -- useful for comparing runs
  or detector settings at a glance.

These numbers describe how well Isolation Forest, as configured today,
separates synthetic anomalies from synthetic ambient background --  they
say nothing yet about real-world performance, since no real hardware or
field data exists to validate against.
