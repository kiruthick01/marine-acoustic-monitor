Anomaly detection.

Implements Stage 2 of the ML pipeline described in docs/ml-pipeline.md:
unsupervised anomaly detection against a learned baseline from an initial
calibration period, run on the joint acoustic+environmental feature vectors
produced by simulation/pipeline/feature_extraction.py. Isolation Forest is
the concrete algorithm used here, one of the two candidates named in
DECISIONS.md (the other being autoencoder reconstruction error).

class BaselineAnomalyDetector:
    """
    Unsupervised anomaly detector wrapping sklearn's IsolationForest.

    Why unsupervised fits the cold-start problem (docs/ml-pipeline.md Stage 2
    and Stage 3 gating):

    At first deployment there is no labeled anomaly data at all -- no field
    recordings exist yet to say "this window was a real anomaly, that one
    wasn't" (see DECISIONS.md: no hardware purchased, no implementation
    code, planning phase). A supervised classifier has nothing to train on
    at this point. Isolation Forest instead only needs unlabeled feature
    vectors from a period assumed to represent normal site conditions (the
    "calibration period" in docs/ml-pipeline.md) -- it isolates points that
    are structurally easy to separate from the rest of the calibration data
    via random recursive partitioning, and scores them as more anomalous the
    fewer partitions it takes to isolate them. This requires no notion of
    "anomaly class" at all, so it works identically whether an eventual
    anomaly turns out to be a vessel passage, a storm runoff event, a sensor
    fault, or something never seen during design -- exactly the property
    needed before Stage 3's labeled/reviewed dataset exists.

    This class is a thin wrapper providing two operations matching the
    pipeline's two distinct phases: `fit()` during the (offline) calibration
    period, `score()` on each new window during (near-real-time, on-device)
    normal operation.

        Args:
            contamination: expected proportion of anomalies in the fitted
                calibration data, passed through to IsolationForest. Default
                "auto" is appropriate here since the calibration period is
                assumed to be normal conditions -- there's no reason to
                expect a specific non-zero anomaly proportion in it.
            random_state: seed for IsolationForest's internal randomness,
                for reproducible fitting.
            threshold_sigma: is_anomaly flags a window when its anomaly_score
                exceeds (calibration mean + threshold_sigma * calibration
                std), both computed by scoring the calibration set itself
                once fitting completes -- not IsolationForest's own
                contamination-based predict() cutoff. That built-in cutoff
                sits close to the calibration set's own score mean (it
                expects contamination's fraction of the *calibration* data
                to already be outliers), which is a poor fit here since the
                calibration period is assumed 100% normal by construction:
                empirically (simulation/scripts/evaluate.py runs) it flagged
                over a quarter of genuinely normal evaluation windows,
                crushing per-type precision. 5 sigma keeps recall on actual
                events (their scores sit far outside the calibration std)
                while requiring a much larger deviation than ordinary
                calibration-period noise before flagging.
