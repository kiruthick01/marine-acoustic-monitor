Synthetic environmental sensor data generator.

Produces synthetic temperature/pH/turbidity/salinity time series matching
the environmental readings a monitoring buoy/dock unit would log once per
duty-cycle window (see docs/data-pipeline.md's `environmental_readings`
schema). Includes realistic diel (day/night) cycling in the baseline and,
optionally, a correlated multi-parameter storm/runoff anomaly event. Exists
so the anomaly-detection pipeline (docs/ml-pipeline.md) can be built and
tested before any real hardware or field data exists -- see DECISIONS.md,
project status is planning/no hardware yet.

Column names throughout (temperature_c, ph, turbidity_ntu, salinity_psu,
and their *_roc rate-of-change counterparts) intentionally match the
`environmental_readings` SQLite schema sketch in docs/data-pipeline.md, so
synthetic data here maps directly onto the real storage schema later.

    """
    Generate baseline (no-anomaly) environmental readings with realistic
    diel cycling plus small random sensor noise.

    Domain reasoning per parameter:
    - Temperature: shallow coastal water temperature tracks solar heating,
      peaking in mid-afternoon and reaching its minimum before dawn -- a
      standard diel thermal lag (water heats/cools slower than air, so the
      peak lags well past solar noon). Modeled as a sine wave with a phase
      offset so the peak falls around 14:00 local time.
    - pH: photosynthesis by algae/phytoplankton consumes dissolved CO2
      during daylight, which raises pH; respiration (no photosynthesis)
      dominates at night and adds CO2 back, lowering pH. This is a well
      documented diel pH cycle in productive coastal/estuarine water,
      modeled here as a smaller-amplitude sine wave in phase with daylight
      hours (peak near mid-afternoon, alongside peak photosynthetic
      activity and warmest water).
    - Turbidity: primarily driven by tidal mixing/resuspension and
      biological/weather events rather than a strong solar diel cycle.
      Modeled here as a flat baseline plus noise only -- tidal-driven
      variability is a real effect but out of scope for this generator's
      simplification.
    - Salinity: in the absence of a freshwater input event (rainfall,
      river discharge -- see `inject_storm_runoff_event`), coastal salinity
      is comparatively stable over a single day. Modeled as a flat baseline
      plus small noise.

    """
    Modify baseline readings to simulate a correlated storm/runoff anomaly.

    Real documented storm runoff impacts on coastal water quality show a
    consistent correlated multi-parameter pattern: turbidity rises sharply
    as rainfall mobilizes sediment and runoff carries particulates into the
    water; salinity drops at the same time because the runoff itself is
    freshwater diluting the local water column; pH becomes unstable
    (oscillates) as runoff chemistry and increased mixing disturb the
    water's normal buffering; and the whole event recovers gradually over
    roughly 2-3 days as sediment settles, tidal flushing dilutes and
    disperses the runoff, and the water column re-equilibrates. This
    correlated shape -- turbidity up and salinity down together, gradual
    multi-day recovery, unstable pH -- is the documented pattern this
    function reproduces, not an exact quantitative match to any one storm.

    Real-world timescale vs. this function's `duration_windows`: a real
    recovery runs roughly 2-3 days (~3000-4300 minutes). `duration_windows`
    is expressed in windows, not minutes, so it compresses or expands to
    that real-world timescale depending on `window_interval_minutes` used
    when `readings` was generated (e.g. at the module's default 10-minute
    interval, ~3.5 days is ~500 windows). For a demo run with few windows,
    pass a smaller `duration_windows` and treat it as a compressed stand-in
    for the same qualitative recovery shape, noted here rather than forcing
    a specific real-time duration.
